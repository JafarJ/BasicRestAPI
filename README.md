## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine with XAMPP for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Import the sql file located inside the SQL folder (WARNING: Write, update and delete functions will only work with the included db) and if using Okta OAuth2 create account and new application to get neccesary data, tutorials on how to get your client started are on the official website https://www.okta.com/, further explanation down below!

### A step by step guide.

Make sure your file is inside Drive:\xampp\htdocs if using XAMPP for the local server. 

Open "conection.php" inside "php" folder and modify the variables $dsn, $user, $password and $dbName to your data.

If you donÂ´t want to use Okta Auth then delete or ignore the "oauth2.php" file inside "php" folder and go to the file "authetication.php" and comment out or delete this line.
